## Caution

When you click `Generate Sequential Image` button, it keeps capturing screenshot of every individual frame and download it until you click it again. Each frame is saved in `.png` format and compressed into a `.zip` in increments of 100. This can take up quite a bit of memory and storage in high frame rate situations.

## How to run local

`npm install` to install all npm dependencies

`npm start` to build and run

The server runs in port `3000`
